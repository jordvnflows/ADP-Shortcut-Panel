ADP CS RS Shortcut Panel

To make things easier to access:
   1) Navigate to the website or web page to pin to your home screen 
   2) Tap the menu icon (3 dots in upper right-hand corner) 
   3) Tap Add to homescreen 
   4) Choose a name for the website shortcut 
   5) Chrome will add it to your home screen.
    
  A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER:
    -Opening from GitHub:
        - will allow you to automatically sign into any of the platforms except for the Plan Sponsor Web (you would need to know those log-in credentials).
        - will be updated once issues arise so it will continuously improve
        
    -Opening from downloaded file:
        - if there's any issues with the panel it may be because it's an older version
        - depending on the browser, not all features are supported (use Chrome)
