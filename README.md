ADP CS RS Shortcut Panel

  To open the shortcut panel, you will need to click on index.html
    - you may save the files, but updates are made on here and so if there's any issues with the panel it may be because it's an older version.
    
  A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER:
    -Opening from GitHub:
        - will allow you to automatically sign into any of the platforms except for the Plan Sponsor Web (you would need to know those log-in credentials).
        - will be updated once issues arise so it will continuously improve
        
    -Opening from downloaded file:
        - if there's any issues with the panel it may be because it's an older version
        - depending on the browser, not all features are supported (use Chrome)
